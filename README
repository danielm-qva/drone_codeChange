Hello..
Requirements for the server:
1 - Install node js (^ 18.0.0) and npm
2 - Install mongodb ^5.0.14

In order for the server to work, we must first enter the following command:
 1- npm install 
 after this step you can see the available commands with:
   -- npm run 
   
   server in runnig mode develoment
     "dev": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development ts-node-dev src/index.ts", 
 
     Command to remove build folder
    "clean": "rm -rf build",

    This is the command for building the server, it generates a build folder with all the necessary files to be able to deploy the server for production
    "build": "tsc",

    Command for the execution of the server ready for production
    "start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production node build/index.js",

    
    Test command
    "test": "cross-env NODE_ENV=test jest",
    "test:coverage": "cross-env NODE_ENV=test jest --coverage",
    "test:watch": "cross-env NODE_ENV=test jest --watchAll"

    
    I will create a folder with a postman collection with all the available endpoints.

   There are two scheduled jobs:
   1 - The first scheduled job runs every day at 12:00 am query creates a folder with a .json file with data.
   2 - The second job is to be running every 30 minutes to verify if the drones are low on charge (below 25%) to make an update and put it in LOADING state.

 note :
The server is created with environments, that is to say, for the test with the test environment and with its database different from those of dev or production.
This configuration can be seen in the package.json and the config/mongoose_connect.ts .
